# LED Cube
Small project of a 5x5x5 monochrome LED Cube, able to display multiple animations.

## Platform
This project uses an Arduino DUE card, because of the need of 30 digital output pins to control the 125 LEDs.

## Video
Here are the first two animations I implemented : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnmDzykxCiA
